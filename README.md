- use browser router
- use type : lol = 'pwet' | 'fart'
- see if possible to keep being logged in (see maatjes mail)
  - current idea would be to use the firebase authentication service (probably kind of acts as a proxy, thus allows for refreshable tokens ???, then use the function gapi.client.setToken({access_token:'.....'}) to authenticate the gapi as a user with authorisation)
