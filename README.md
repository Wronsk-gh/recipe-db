# recipe-db
Created with CodeSandbox

/- use browser router
/- see if possible to keep being logged in (see maatjes mail)
  - current idea would be to use the firebase authentication service (probably kind of acts as a proxy, thus allows for refreshable tokens ???, then use the function gapi.client.setToken({access_token:'.....'}) to authenticate the gapi as a user with authorisation)
- use type : lol = 'pwet' | 'fart'
/- implement a responsive design via react bootstrap
- decide if using dedicated months for ingredients having both fresh or storage properties (or declare as 2 ingredients)
- implement custom tags for recipes
- implement new filter for recipes (contains at least some fresh ingredients, contains a specific ingredient)
- sort ingredients alphabetically
- implement modal using bootstrap
- implement in the database a setting of the folder in drive to fetch pictures and new recipe from
- Allow a user to configure the visualisation to be based on another user content (how to give permission ?)
- Delete ingredients button
